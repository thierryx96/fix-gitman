# fix-gitman....

Fix up / implement missing parts of code, the repository owner will choose then the best (or most likely the funkiest) solution to the problem.

# How to proceed :

1. Got to gitman.co, register with the given code
2. Choose a bounty to fix, the bounty match the files from this repositories.
3. Choose `Start work`, this will fork this repository for you, and create a branch where you can get started.
4. Fix the issue or implement the missing parts, then commit whatever is needed on this current branch.
5. Once everything is completed, you can create the PR from gitman using `Submit as pull request`. Alternatively you can create the PR from Github.


Repeat for each exercise!

# Hints:

- You must only use github to write and commit.
- Use only the branch that has been created for you to implement your solution.
- Send one PR per file.
- Using codepen.io or other editor online can help checking it actually works as expected.
